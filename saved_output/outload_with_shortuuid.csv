    W. M. BOCKIUS,
    [p. 564] a progressive farmer of Shenango Township, owns a fine farm of
    forty acres, on which he has passed his life since he was ten years old.
    He was born in Hickory Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, January
    27, 1848, and is a son of John and Elizabeth (Martin) Bockius.
    The grandfather was Daniel Bockius, who took part in the War of 1812. He
    was born in 1782, in Holland, where he learned the trade of bookbinding.
    This he followed in Philadelphia, and also after settling in Lawrence
    County, on the State line, about one-half mile above Eastbrook, and in
    the libraries through this section may yet be found specimens of his
    skill. Little is known of the grandmother except that her name was
    Rachel and that she was of Scotch birth.

    THOMAS, WALTER B., was born in Ewhurst Green, Sussex County, England, 
    on December 31, 1819, and died in Carbondale, Pa., on May 13, 1897.
    His parents were both members of the Methodist Church, and at an 
    early age united with the same Church.  He preached his first sermon at 
    seventeen years of age.  he did service in the ranks of the local 
    ministry sixteen years before coming to America.  After coming to this 
    country he did work as a supply under Rev. Zachariah Paddock, presiding 
    elder, for a short time and in 1853 joined Wyoming Conference.
    In October, 1853, he married Miss Abigail Caroline Turner, of Silver 
    Lake, Pa.  On September 1, 1884, after suffering from pulmonary disease 
    for some time, she passed from their pleasant home in Athens, Pa., to 
    heavenly mansions.  Husband and wife are buried in the cemetery at 
    Athens, Pa.  One son was born to them, Professor A. P. Thomas, now 
    living at Carbondale.
    When he retired from active work, and the proposition was made to 
    make his claim upon the superannuates'' fund first class instead of 
    second, with grace and magnanimity he objected, saying, "I can earn a 
    little, and others may suffer if my claim is increased."  He did good 
    work at bookbinding for a number of years.
    His pastoral record is as follows:  1853, Montrose; 1854, Berkshire; 
    1855, Vestal; 1856-57, Athens; 1858-59, Nichols; 1860-61, Orwell; 1862-

    1904, pp. 353-4.
    "OWEN LEWIS WOODWARD.  The Woodward family of Chester county, Pennsylvania,
    represented in the present generation by H. Bell Woodward, who, since the
    death of her father, Owen Lewis Woodward, which occurred January 21, 1894,
    has successfully managed his large estate which is located in West Vincent
    township, trace their ancestry to Richard Woodward, son of Robert Woodward,
    of Rockland Manor, New Castle county, Delaware, and Birmingham, Chester
    county, Pennsylvania, who married, in 1705, Mary Nayle, the only heir of
    Henry Nayle of Thornbury, and they were the parents of seven children -
    Henry, John, Richard, Thomas, Deborah, Mary and Alice Woodward.
    "Thomas Woodward, fourth son of Richard and Mary Woodward, was born in East
    Bradford township, Chester county, November 7, 1722 or 1723.  By deeds of
    conveyance he became the owner of one hundred acres of land in the neigh-
    borhood of his birth place, resided on Street road, and was engaged in
    bookbinding, also in surveying and conveyancing.  He was the owner of a
    large number of negro slaves, whom he liberated after listening to an
    address of John Woolman, a noted Quaker preacher and an anti-slavery ad-
    herent.  Mr. Woodward was a member of Concord Monthly Meeting, and obtained
    his certificate of removal to New Garden Monthly Meeting, dated April 5,
    1749, which was about the time he settled in East Marlborough and became a
    member of Londongrove Particular Meeting.  On October 26, 1745, he married
    Elizabeth Jacobs, widow of John Jacobs, and daughter of Roger and Eliza-
    beth (Richards) Kirk, the ceremony being performed at East Nottingham
    Meeting.  Elizabeth Woodward was born February 15, 1721; her father, Roger
    Kirk, a native of Lurgan, North Ireland, was among the pioneers of Not-
    tingham, and located in East Nottingham as early as 1712, where he pur-
    chased large tracts of land.  About 1714, Mr. Kirk married Elizabeth
    Richards, of Aston township, and granddaughter of Joseph and Jane Richards,
    who came from England and settled in Chichester township, now Delaware
    county.  The children born to Mr. and Mrs. Woodward were - Rebecca, Eliza-
    beth, Samuel, Thomas, Deborah, Timothy and Susanna Woodward.  The father
    of these children died June 15, 1785; the mother passed away January 25,
    1812.

'Robert','Baur',' Wilkes-Barre','PA','baur-robert-pa','     ROBERT BAUR, editor and publisher, is the eldest son of the Rev. Frederick
    and Caroline (Hahn) Baur.  He was born in Wurtemberg, Germany, and received
    a liberal education, learning the bookbinder''s trade.  In 1848 he emigrated
    to the United States, locating in Philadelphia, Pa., where he remained
    three years, working at his trade.  In 1851 he came to Wilkes-Barre and
    established his present business, which he has continued in with marked
    success.  In 1851 he purchased the Watcher, established in 1842, which he
    now publishes in connection with his son, Gustav Adolph.  He also publishes
    the Council Chat, the organ of the Junior Order United American Mechanics;
    also a German paper devoted to the interest of the Musical Societies,
    called the Singers Gazette.  Mr. Baur is also engaged in book-binding,
    doing an extensive business in that line, and he is largely interested in
    Wilkes-Barre and Luzerne county real estate.  In 1854 Mr. Baur married
    Paulina, daughter of the Rev. Hassold, of Wurtemberg, Germany, and by this
    marriage he has had eight children, all of whom are deceased excepting
    Emily and Gustav Adolph, the latter of whom married Miss Kate Davis, and
    has one son, Robert Adolph.  In his political views our subject is a
    prominent Democrat, and while he never would accept public offices, he has
    always taken a deep interest in the success of his party.  Mr. Baur is one
    of the leading citizens of Wilkes-Barre; is the oldest editor in this part
    of the State, and the oldest living publisher and editor now residing in
    Wilkes-Barre.

New York 1.

Bookbinder, New York, cir. 1820-1840

Bookbinder, Xenia, Ohio,

born Hull, Yorkshire England, early 1800''s

Died Oxford Indiana 1871

Son: Robert Champley, bookbinder 2 .

1. (1821)  "returns his acknowledgments to his patrons, the booksellers,
publishers and citizens of new York... for the liberal encouragement he has
experienced during the past year and informs them that he still carries on the
above business, in its various branches of morocco, calf and Russia elegant
and plain bindings- the calf bindings colored in solid plain colors, or in
imitation of tortoise shell, japanning, wood and marbles of various kinds, and
in a very superior manner." New York Evening Post Jan. 17, 1821.

  
2.George Champley was a native of Hull, England, and at an early age learned
bookbinding, which he followed most of his life. In 1818, he and his family
immigrated to Montreal, Canada, where he worked as a journeyman one winter: he
then went to New York , began business for himself, and continued twenty
years, during which he spent three years in Mexico. After returning, he moved
to Warren County Ohio, and operated a store: this he continued two years after
which he went to Xenia, Ohio, resumed bookbinding, and five years later
removed to Center Township, Benton County, Ind. Mr. Champley was a member of
the Masonic fraternity, and died January 15, 1871 (1).

  
There is a strong possibility that the grave in the cemetery, located in Oak
Grove Twp. on state road 352 near Oxford, Indiana, ( row 11 lot 11 old
division) is his and Charlotte''s final resting place. He appears in this area
in the 1870 Benton County, Oak Grove Twp. census.

  
FROM AN 1830 LETTER FROM MARTIN VAN BUREN REGARDING CHAMPLEY''S TRIP TO MEXICO.

  
MARTIN VAN BUREN. Department of State, Washington, 1830 December 28. Jackson''s
future Vice President and eighth U.S. President writes to Anthony Butler in
Mexico.

In full: "Permit me to introduce to you, Mr. George Champley, a citizen of New
York who is about to embark for Mexico, on a tour through the Southern
Republics. His views are partly commercial & partly Scientific and any
friendly attentions you may have it in your power to show him will be esteemed
a favor by Your friend & Servant".

Democrat Martin Van Buren had been U.S. Senator (1821-1828) and Governor of
New York (January 1st to March 12, 1829) before serving as Jackson''s Secretary
of State. George Champley had been born in England, emigrated to Montreal with
his wife and ten month old son in 1818 and then settled in New York City. They
traveled a great deal, spending three years in Mexico (1831-1833), and later
moved to Ohio, where they opened a bookstore. Champley was a Democrat and a
student of history, especially of his native England.

  
New York passenger lists 1820-1957 show George Campley arriving in NY from the
State of Tabasco, Mexico on the brigantine Tabasco on 7/16/1832 and also

California 1.

"Established as Cook & LeCount , March 1850; changed to LeCount & Strong, Nov.
1852, and to present style Feb. 1865. This complete and extensive
establishment unsurpassed in the United States deserves more than a passing
notice. Its present proprietor in conjunction with his associate, commenced
business in the infancy of the city, and has participated in its early
vicissitudes caused by the conflagrations which were so destructive. In the
early part of 1853 , the present splendid structure occupied by Mr. LeCount
was erected at an expense of $82,000 and exhibits, in all its details,
completeness of adaption, the result of the perfect acquaintance of its
enterprising owner in the business in which he is engaged, It is 26 by 90
feet, and four stories in height, One of its early and most successful
merchants Mr L. considers as his permanent home the city which his enterprise
has aided to enlarge and adorn." San Francisco directory 1856-57 page 126.

Some doubt should be raised as to the march 1850 establishment of partnership.
The Business is not found in the Bogardus May 1850 Directory. They are listed
in the Kimball September 1850 Directory.

From the advertisement this seems to be a well established firm offering:
printing, publishing, bookselling, lithography as well as binding. It is
likely that this firm had been established for some time. Wm B Cooke was
listed in Bogardus 1850 directory as a bookseller and stationer (wholesale and
retail) at this address. LeCount, from later listings, is clearly a
bookbinder. It should be noted that Bogardus directory was published in May
1850 and there was no mention of the LeCount partnership that LeCount states
as having taken place in March of 1850.

Folke J. Svensson

Bookbinder

Sacramento

California![svensen4.jpg][2]

Folke Jonatan Svensson was born in Lysekil, Sweden on Jan 1, 1914. He grew up
in Molndal, a small city south of Gothenburg. His father was a very skilled
stonemason.

Folke was the youngest of seven children. His siblings went into nursing,
baking and tailoring. Folke chose bookbinding. For two years, starting at age
18, he trained at Slöjdföreningen, Gothenberg, a well-known school for
artisans. He became very skilled in all aspects of bookbinding.

Folke continued his education by taking evening classes in math, management
and English. For five years he worked in Gothenburg doing hand binding, then
went into industrial bookbinding. He became an employee of Oberg and Son in
Eskiltuna, where he became a foreman in the loose-leaf binders department.
Later he moved to the big Esselte Company in Norrkoping, where he was made a
time-study engineer.

In 1950 Folke took a leave of absence from Esselte and traveled to Montreal,
Canada, at the invitation of two German immigrants who wanted to start a
bookbinding business and needed help learning how to use machines that Folke
was familiar with. For nine months he trained the owners and workers until
they were off to a good start in their enterprise.

Before returning to Sweden Folke wanted to have seen really big binderies,
which meant going to the U.S. He was given a visa and hired by Burkhardt and
Co. in Detroit, starting July 1951. He joined the union, the International
Brotherhood of Bookbinders. For the first time in his life he experienced
tension between the black and white workers.

Folke wanted to see a bit more of the U.S. and he did not want to experience
the Detroit winter, known to be harsher than Sweden''s, so in early December he
headed south in his Dodge. He came to the Gulf Coast, but his goal was to
reach California. The sightseeing was interesting, and American apple pie and
coffee was a "given" at every rest stop. By Christmas he basked on the warm
beaches of Los Angeles.

In a Swedish church he found new friends, and he felt at home. At the union
office he was referred to the Silverlake Bindery, which also owned Ward
Ritchie Press. Anderson, Ritchie and Simon was well known for special order
work. The Limited Edition Club was one of the customers. Folke fit right in.
He soon knew that he would stay in California and wrote his resignation letter
to Esselte. Folke went to night school. He became an American citizen. Things
were going well. Folke was ready to marry, settle down, and have a family. He
had kept in touch with his Swedish friend, Sara. Here the story changes from
"he" to "we": Folke and I were married in Sweden July 10, 1954.

In August we were in Los Angeles. Folke returned to his job. We bought a home.
I went to UCLA and got a B.S. degree. Our first child, Lisbet, was born in
1958. The smog was a big problem and we moved to Sacramento. Folke first
worked at Ray White and Son, later at the State Printing Office (S.P.O.). We
bought a big residential lot in the South Land Park area.

Because of the layoffs at S.P.O. we had to leave and return to Los Angeles in
1961, this time to live and work near the ocean. Folke was hired by the UCLA
bindery and did special work for UCLA Library''s Special Collections. We bought
a home in Mar Vista, five minutes from the beach. In March 1963 our twins,
Kristina and Maria, were born.

We stayed in Mar Vista long enough to become part of an intricate thirty-three
family carpool. That made it possible for our three girls to attend UCLA
elementary and preschool, which was a much sought after privilege. Even so, we
saw Sacramento as a better city in which to bring up children. We returned to
Sacramento in what would be our last move. Folke designed a home for the big
lot, hired a good builder, and in Jan 1967 we moved into 4608 Sunset Drive.

A big workshop was part of the home. Folke gathered bookbinding equipment and
machinery until he had a complete bindery at home. In the meantime he worked
at the S.P.O. from which he retired in Jan 1, 1974. He now opened his own
business under the name Sacramento Bindery. Mr. Herb Caplan had a bookstore
for old and rare California books. Folke became invaluable to him for repairs
and restoration. Theirs was a very special friendship. Others came to Folke
with theses, professional journals, and special collections. His specialty was
restoring old family bibles.

Folke never sought recognition for himself or his work. What he made spoke for
itself. He counted it a privilege to have worked with the best in the field of
book production.

Merle Armitage was a book designer of far reaching influence. The Merle
Armitage Bibliography by Robert Marks was published in 1956. In his bold
handwriting Mr. Armitage write in a copy he gave to Folke: for Swensson, the
fine craftsman.

In 1984 Ward Ritchie was recognized for his fifty year contribution to the art
of making fine books. A reception in his honor was held at the California
State Library, Sacramento. Folke was invited as a guest. He was greeted by Mr.
Ritchie with a joyous, "O Folke, my bookbinder!" Photos were taken and later
sent to Folke''s home. Theirs was a mutual respect for highest quality work but
also a personal friendship.

Folke was a quality man in all he did and he bound books to last. He was also
very generous. As a gift he rebound sixty hymnals for a Sunday school in his
church in 1983. Those books have been in use every Sunday for twenty-five
years. They are still in good shape because he used highest grade materials.
Folke''s greatest gift was to the First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley in
1991. Our daughter Maria had graduated from UC Berkeley and was married in
that church. Folke offered to rebind all their hymnals. They had over 600! He
gave them choice of buckram, and they chose a lavender cloth at $15 per yard
to match the sanctuary carpet. It was a huge task that became a family affair.
Our daughter Liz Leighton helped, doing an outstanding job. Folke did all the
goldstamping. Every book had "Hymnal" on the spine and on the front cover at
the top: "Hymns for the Family of God;" at the bottom: "First Presbyterian
Church of Berkeley." The church used those hymnals for many years until they
changed to a new type of songbook, which is used only in the sanctuary (see
postscript below).

The last three years of his life, Folke did no bookbinding. His back had
become very bent. His height had gone from 6''1" to 5''. He died on Nov. 18,
2005 at the age of 91. Folke is very much missed by his family and his
friends. He left us good memories. He also left us his own very fine library
of forty Swedish books. He was an avid reader. While in his twenties he bought
paperback versions of mostly classic books and bound them exquisitely. Most
are bound in leather of various kinds, full leather, or a combination of
leather and his own marbled paper. All are goldstamped, most also have gold
edges on the top of the pages.

  
Sara Svensson

Sacramento, May 19, 2008

  
P.S. This last week I had a sunshine experience. I wanted to know what had
happened to the hymnals Folke had rebound for the church in Berkeley. So I
called "First Pres" and talked to

Pat Nicholson, who said she remembers well when Folke''s gift came. She told me
that the church now has new hymnals only in the sanctuary. In all the other
rooms, and there are many that are used for Sunday schools, youth work, music,
clubs, etc., the lavender hymnals remain: "and they are in very good shape."
She promised to send me two copies, which arrived on May 17. One is in the box
to the bookbinder''s museum. It makes me grateful and proud of Folke''s legacy
as a quality man.

1893 Collection ABM prov.TJ

On July 6, 1893 The New York Times reported that James Grange was charged with
forgery and had fled the country. "There is probably $75,000 worth of forged
paper out, Mr Gilhooley thought. The liabilities will reach about $200,000 and
the assets are all in a maze." N.Y. Times 7/6/1893

"The failure of James Grange, the Duane street bookbinder, New York, who made
an assignment in June to his lawyer, Andrew Gilhooly, as a bad one. Forgery,
absconding and a dual private life are some of its fresher features.

On June 19 James Grange went to his lawyer in the most jaunty way in the world
and told him that he was unable to "meet his obligations." Since that day he
has not been seen by any of his anxious creditors, nor have detectives been
able to trace him. It is said that a hansom blonde, whom he frequently drove
out in his wagon with a pretty piece of horseflesh between the shafts, is the
companion of his flight."

..."He thought that the liabilities would far exceed the $100,000 limit. He
had heard of forgeries by his client, and he was not prepared to say that they
would not amount to as much as $30,000. There was machinery in the building
that cost $95,000." from: "The American Bookbinder" Vol IV, no.4 Sept 1893

    Peter Rangaves ( Feb. 19, 1921-  Aug. 25,2008  )  
      
    Trade Bindery (1951-1996)  
      
    Born into a Greek family in Brooklyn, New York, Peter spent his youth in Athens, Greece.   
    
    
    He learned the trade by working for his Uncles'' bookbindery in Athens. At 18 years old, Peter   
    
    
    came back to the United States and settled in San Francisco. Here he worked three jobs, as a   
    
    
    waiter, singer, and in a bookbindery. Soon his parents and four brothers joined him to live in   
    
    
    San Francisco. In 1951 his boss was ready to sell Peter his business. Every bank turned Peter  
    
    
     down for a loan until he went to Bank of America where the loan officer looked at him and   
    
    
    said, " I trust you to pay the loan back." So at 30 years of age, Peter bought his former bosses''   
    
    
     business and changed the name to Trade Bindery.  In the beginning days he was so afraid to   
    
    
    miss a business call, that he telephoned his mother to keep the line busy while he went to use   
    
    
    the bathroom! He built his business, married, raised a family and forty-five years later retired   
    
    
    to Sonoma County, California.

had received the forged bills from Joseph brought them back. Joseph did not
deny that he had given the man the counterfeit bills, and he offered to
exchange them for legal tender. As he did so , however, he was "in an Agony an
Trembled"; an hour later he packed up his bags and absconded to Philadelphia
in the middle of the night, leaving his wife Catherine and their six-year old
son. The authorities never found Joseph but they arrested Catherine for trying
to put "a great number " of bills into circulation She was convicted of a
misdemeanor (the court assumed that she had not been a part of their

Eureka

California

Established 1854, prior to the incorporation of the town, later to be the
city, of Eureka. As of 2008 it was under the fourth generation of family
ownership. Although they are no longer doing binding they remain sucsessful
printers.

Below are some images of a machine used by the Times Printing  bookbinders,
probably, as a case smoothing machine.  The machine was made by McFarlane Ltd.
of Glasgow. The ABM has no other information about this firm. It is possible
that this machine was intended for some other purpose as the rollers are
wooden and to light duty to serve as a signature rolling machine  and the few
images we have of case rolling machines tend to be less elaborate  almost home
made.

7. Bookbinder, Bookseller, and Blank Book Manufacturer. Issued a 40 page
catalog of books in 1804. Was the  areas largest Blank Book Manufacturer until
Lexington business was overtaken by the Ohio River Cities. "William Essex was
a substantial businessman, a founder and vestryman of Christ Episcopal Church,
and very highly regarded, until about 1817. Essex at that time converted all
of his business assets into cash, "absconded with his wife''s housekeeper," and
took off for New York or Canada. His creditors hired a "stout Irishman" to
pursue him, and they managed to collect some of the money due them, but they
must have been amazed by Essex''s explanation that it was all right that he had
left his wife because he was never married to her in the first place." Burton
Milward, The Kentucky Press, The Kentucky Review, vol. XI, no.3 Autumn 1992.

2. (1816) First Publisher in the region.  McArdle gave notice in his Ohio
Register that the paper would not be published for two weeks because of the
large amount of bookbinding, for the State, that needed to be done. 1 Hill &
Graham, History of Knox County Ohio, pg. 362.

3.(1817) On the 15th of October, 1817, the first six months of the second
volume of the Ohio Register having been completed, the editor calls upon
subscribers to pay up old scores-

"For without this one thing necessary, it is impossible to expect that we can
live; money would be preferable, but if that is scarce with you, rags, wheat,
rye, corn, and almost all kinds of market produce will be taken in payment."

On the 5th of November he proposes to "take for subscription, advertisements,
hand-bills or bookbinding, wheat, rye, corn, buckwheat, &c., delivered at
Davis'' mill in this town, in preference to some uncharted paper." (A sly dig
this at the Owl Creek Bank, Mr. McArdle.) M.A. Banning Norton, A History of
Knox County Ohio pg. 247.

"Edward C. Williams Family Papers. Pennsylvania Historical & Museum
Commission, Civil War Holdings.

2. The following information was accompanying an image that was offered to the
museum. The source is unknown and hence uncredited.  "EDWARD CHARLES WILLIAMS,
son of Charles and Rebecca (Adams) Williams, was born February 10,1820, in the
city of Philadelphia. His father was a native of Philadelphia; his mother, of
Mount Holly, N. J. The son learned the trade of a bookbinder with Jacob
Snyder, completing it with Robert P. Desilver. He shortly after came to
Harrisburg, where he established himself in business, firm of Clyde &
Williams, bookbinders and stationers. For several years they did the State
binding and also published several important works. In December, 1846, upon
the call for volunteers for the war with Mexico, Mr. Williams raised a company
called the Cameron Guards, which were accepted and formed a part of the Second
Pennsylvania regiment. Previous to going to Mexico he had been connected
several years with the old Dauphin Guards, one of the finest military
organizations in the State, and was in service during the Philadelphia riots
of 1844. Upon Captain Williams'' return from Mexico he was elected as an
Independent, in 1850, to the office of sheriff of Dauphin county, serving the
full term. When the Rebellion broke out and a demand was made for more troops,
Governor Curtin sent for General Williams, who had been commissioned several
years prior brigadier general of the Dauphin county militia, and at once
directed the organization of Camp Curtin. After organizing Camp Curtin, he
organized Camp Slifer, at Chambersburg. He commanded a brigade during the
three months'' service, was with Patterson in the Shenandoah, and subsequently
mustered out at Washington city. He was then appointed by President Lincoln,
through Secretary of War Cameron, colonel of the Lochiel  cavalry, directed to
raise twenty-four companies of that branch of the service, which he
accomplished in a very short time. It was difficult to handle three battalions
of raw cavalry, but by hard work General Williams got his command into
splendid discipline and drill. He went into camp at Jeffersonville, Ind.,
where he exchanged his Pennsylvania horses for good Kentucky stock. After
inspection by General Buford, he was ordered to the front under General Buell.
On reaching Green River, and when ready to cross the stream, General Williams
was directed to take the advance, but the same evening the news of the capture
of Fort Donelson obviating that movement, he was ordered back, and his command
cut up and distributed over Kentucky and Tennessee. His own regiment, the
Ninth cavalry, became very popular in that section with all classes of people,
owing to their good discipline and behavior. General Williams was at Henderson
with his regiment when Buell and Bragg made their march into Kentucky, was
ordered to Louisville without delay, and from thence to Crab Orchard, where he
prevented Kirby Smith''s cavalry from entering Kentucky at that point. Owing,
however, to a question of rank, in which not only he but the other officers in
the volunteer service were concerned, he pre-emptorily resigned and returned
to Pennsylvania. He was twice married; first, January 16, 1843, to Selina,
daughter of John Heltzel, of Harrisburg; second, June 5, 1873, at Chapman,
Pa., to Mrs. A. E. Hetzel".

1. (1790) "The house of Henry Altemus is of long standing. It was established
in 1790 by Schadrack Taylor who was succeeded in the business by his
apprentice and nephew, Joseph T. Altemus.the father of the present
proprietor." (Henry Altemus)  Joseph T. Altemus won a widespread reputation
for the quality of his bindings and was specially noted for fine finishing and
tooling. Many of the labor-saving devices now employed were introduced by him.
He imported from England a coggle press, which he arranged so as to do certain
classes of finishing on the sides of books that had been done previously by
hand. This was practically the first introduction in the country of stamping
on the sides of books. Afterward, under his personal supervision, he had made
a large embossing press for heavy relief work, This effected a great
revolution in bookbinding. Besides improvements made by him in many of the
processes of bookbinding he originated many styles of binding, a number of
which have since become standare, Among these are: Heavy panelled and bevelled
boards, inlaid sides, embossed leather backs and cloth sides of school-books
in place of the old style full-skiver binding."  He would be succeeded by his
son Henry. Publishers'' Weekly no. 752. June 26, 1886 pg. 804.

succeeded to the business, just having completed his term of service as
apprentice in his father''s bindery. He brought with him the same progressive
spirit into the business, he was the first to use cutting machines for
trimming the edges of books, and among the first to use the backing machine,
both of which are now found in every bookbindery in the country, He was among
the first to manufacture photograph albums in this country, and introduced the
well-known patented hinge-back album, the strongest album made. He was the
first bookbinder to sew books by wire, by which process at present fully fifty
per cent of books produced in London, Berlin and Leipsic (sic) are sewed.
London alone operating over 700 machines The firm  occupies the five storied
building 507-513 Cherry street, its capacity of production being 5000 books
per day"  Publishers'' Weekly no. 752. June 26, 1886 pg. 804.

Iberville Parish, and that, on the morning of the 21st July, Steele, in

got possession of him, and bore him off. They were pursued by the overseer,
and overtaken at Iberville, where a criminal prosecution was commenced against
Steele and Holliday , by the owners of the boy." ... its appears, from what we

The image is of what could be referred to as a Job ticket.  Job tickets would
be inserted into the book when it arrived at the bindery and would contain the
customers name and instruction for binding. The ticket would travel with the
book block as it progressed through the various binding operations and would
be removed  when the book was invoiced and readied for return to the customer.
Job tickets  are still used today by library binders who might need to bind
hundreds of different books and to reconnect them to one of dozens of
different clients. Because of their ephemeral nature these examples of the
internal working of a bookbindery rarely survive. This example survived
because it was mistakenly bound into the volume. One can imagine the binder
searching the bindery for this slip of paper so he return the book to the
proper owner.

This particular example was found in The Lutheran Quarterly, Valentine,
vol.13  on e-bay 250810907551  4 /25/ 11. our thanks to Steve Beare for
calling attention to this image.

2. (1849)Died at San Francisco, on the 11th of October last, Mr. Elnathan Jones.
Mr Jones was for several years an inhabitant of this city, but carried on his business, that of  a bookbinder, in Boston, where he was well known.He was a man of estimable character, of kind and generous feelings, a friendly neighbor, a faithful and affectionate husband and father, He leaves behind, a wife and three children, the eldest eleven years old. Mr. Jones embarked from N. York, in the Crescent City, for Chargres, early in the Summer. While waiting at Panama for a passage to San Francisco, he was seized with the Panama fever, so called, from which he had but partially recovered, when he took passage in the Tasso, for California. After an apparent convalescence of considerable duration, he relapsed and continued to  decline, with short intervals only of hope, until the vessel anchored in the port of San Francisco. His death and the termination of the passage of the vessel, took place nearly at the same hour. On the afternoon of the following day, he was buried in the cemetery of Dan Francisco"...Cambridge Chronicle, 20 December 1849.

1()."The Brattleboro Bookstore, William Fessenden died suddenly in Northampton, Massachusetts on January 20, 1815. His widow was Patty Holbrook, the daughter of John Holbrook of Brattleboro. Mrs. Patty Fessenden owned the large two-and-a-half story brick building that William had built specifically for a bookstore.
This bookstore is mentioned in an August 20, 1817 deed that was drawn up when Patty Fessenden bought the strip of land that became the lane, or alley between the present-day Richardson Block and the American Building.
A few feet north of our old hovel is a block or row of brick buildings, used principally for merchants'' stores. One of them is a bookstore and bindery, in which extensive business is carried on in connection with the paper-making and printing establishments before mentioned.Letter Written In Brattleboro 1836,
Stephen Greenleaf, Jr.". http://brattleborohistory.com/


2. (1824)(+-)  Paper is manufactured here in Holbrook''s paper mill to the amount of 19 or 1$2,000. and in his printing and bookbinding establishment business is done to the amount of 20 to $25000 annually.

VT,

1. (1816)  "In 1816, owing to the death of his son-in-law, William Fessenden, who
married his daughter Patty, and was for many years an enterprising
paper-maker, printer, bookbinder and dealer, as well as publisher of one
of Brattleboro''s first newspapers, it was necessary for Mr. Holbrook to return to Brattleboro to assume charge of the business, which he subsequently enlarged after taking as partner Joseph Fessenden, brother of William, who was also a son-in-law, under the firm name Holbrook & Fessenden. The pure whiteness and clearness of the post and letter paper made at their mill were said to be due to the purity of spring water for which the town was noted. For undertaking to publish a large family Bible, by subscription, in this obscure town, so far away from the centers of trade, Mr. Holbrook was
ridiculed by the foremost publishers of the day in New York and Boston,
and certain failure by them was confidently predicted ; but they little knew
the character or capabilities of the man. In spite of prophecy and dis- couragement, he supplied all subscribers with the Bible and made it a complete financial success. Mr. Holbrook retired from active business, though still associated withthe firm Holbrook & Fessenden from 1832 to 1837, when he became presi- dent of the Brattleboro Bank."
